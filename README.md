# template-binding

HTML5 already defining `<template>`, unfortunately the spec does not come with template binding capability.

This library works as steroid to `<template>`, to do,

- Render template content to specified element
- Annotate template content to properties
- Bind template content to model object
- Provide getter setter to model object to adapt annotated template content
